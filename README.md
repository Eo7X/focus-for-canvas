# Focus for Canvas
Canvas is an assignment-management system that many schools use to assign homework, tests, and more. However, they've implemented a policy that if you view the assignment grades pages too much, the grades will become blurred and Canvas will ask you to come back later. This may have had the right intentions but is really just a huge annoyance. The Focus for Canvas extension sits in your Chromium-based browser's menu bar and automatically removes the blur over your grades on Canvas. Just install it and forget they were even blurred in the first place. Focus for Canvas is available for all Chromium-based browsers, including but not limited to Google Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge. It is available on the Chrome Web Store at [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/focus-for-canvas-remove-t/ihdpcfonbpkbbkmfbefahelibpmlmfie].
